The list of what we want to do is:

1. We will use HTML/Javascript as a building block/scafold to build the webpage/website,
2. Later on, we will use Next.js or React.js to build on top of the webpage/website. Alchemy and INFURA are third party blockchain which we may need to interact with the blockchains. We need them to create a provider or node to send your transacctions to. We take the Alchemy or INFURA URL and stick it to some object in the code and use it to send some transaction.

There are also some couple of wallets apart from metamask such as MEW wallet, Ledger, Coinbase, walletconnect, imToken, ans so on, but they all do the same thing where they expose some kinds of URLs or some nodes or providers at the backend
